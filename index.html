                In this blog, The topic of Ryomen Sukuna has to be spoken about. Ryomen Sukuna is a character made by Gege Akutami in the series known
                as "Jujutsu Kaisen" poses as the main anatagonist. Sukuna is a character that lives for himself and his won enjoyment while not caring
                about the consequences or how it affects anyone else in the process. He is one of those characters that you just love and appreciate 
                due to his non-chalant to the world and how no matter the words from other people still lives by his own right and ideology.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sukuna is a heavily favoured character as he has quite a few iconic or downright amazing fight sequences in the series. One such sequence
                is the fight between Sukuna and another favoured character known as Gojo Satoru (another favorite character of mine). This fight last 36
                chapters of this series ending in the victor being Ryomen Sukuna heavily because of plot due to many inferences Gojo should have won. 
                After this fight, Sukuna ran the gauntlet with the rest of the cast which ended in his life and ideology being proven wrong by the main
                protagonist Yuji Itadori.

            <h3>About Jahi Bennett</h3>
            <p>
                As you may already now, my name is Jahi Bennett. I am currently a Computer Science Major at the University of the 
                West Indies. I grew up in two different parishes: Kingston and St. Catherine with both my parents and grandparents.
                During my childhood, I attended Vaz Preparatory School where I picked up on the beginner level of social skills which
                further helped in my progression to high school. This said high school being the prestigious Wolmers' Boys School which 
                further inspired me to pursue my dreams of being a successful person in cybersecurity.
